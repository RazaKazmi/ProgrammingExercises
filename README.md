# ProgrammingExercises
A repository for some programming exercises and principles from different books, mainly using C++.

## Building
The exercises use **CMake** to create the makefile for building.
These are small exercises that are too small to call their own project and did not need to tied down to a specific IDE, notably visual studio
as these were created on windows. Use CMake to build the executables for the exercises.
