# ProgrammingExercises
A repository for some programming exercises, from the book Programming Principles using C++.

## Special Note
There is another repository **ProgrammingPrinciples**, which has the same purpose of this one.  
__*So why is does this repository exist?*__  
The main reason is because these exercises are meant to be their own small programs with executables. However 
the other repository is built using visual studios and missing some early exercises. Since visual studios only allows one main.cpp per project, 
and some of these exercises are too small to be declared as their own project, this repository will focus on having these exercises be their own program
with their own executables. The other repository will slowly be merged and refactored into this one.
